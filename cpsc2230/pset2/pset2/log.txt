I discussed my solution with: n/a;

DISCUSSION
my code had many errors at first, especially with file parsing. What was helpful was making the test.c file, 
and testing each function/journey build method (ie -given flag), separately. It is also included in the makefile 
(if submitted). Perhaps what was most oppressive was debugging before this method: it was impossible to test 
without a workbench provided as such. In the future I must remedy this by beginning with such a file. Perhaps 
the best way to test is this workbench format, and testing the code modularly. I did not discuss the code with 
anyone (including TAs) for more than 10 minutes; in my experience, I work best alone... but I am open to seeing 
that change...
